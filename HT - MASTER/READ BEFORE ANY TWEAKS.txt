Please remember that I have not tested this application on Windows 8 or 11, so I cannot guarantee that it will work with those operating systems. 
If you use this application on Windows 8 or 11, you do so at your own risk and acknowledge that I cannot support those systems. 
Thank you very much.

You MUST have an internet connection for the program to work!!

ALWAYS CREATE A RESTORE POINT BEFORE ANY TWEAKS!!

This tweaks normally remove some useless windows services , if you dont want to remove those kind of services , dont run the tweak.
